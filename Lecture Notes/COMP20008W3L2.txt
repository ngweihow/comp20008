Similarity Measures
	Item-based Method
		Search for similarity between items
		Computation can be done offline
		More stable than user-user similarity
		
		Find similar items to the one that has a missing rating
		
		
	User-user/ item-item similarity
	
	
	
	Matrix-Based Techniques
		Many matrices can be factorised into two different matrices
		R =est UV
		R is m*n, U is m*k and V is k*n
		k is the number of latent factors
		increasing k would increase accuracy but only up to a certain level
			slows down the computation
		
		Intuitive process
			Come up with an initial guess for u and v
			Find a product of u and v and see how far it deviates from R
			Move towards R with better guesses
			
			
			
			
Visualisation and Data Clustering
	
	Iris Flower Data Sets
		Measure flowers' sepal width, petal width and length
		
		
	Scatter plots
		Different colours for different species/types comparing
		Do a comparision of combinations of features
		
	Heat maps
		Plot the data matrix
		Shows intensity of clusters
		Do normalisation before plotting heat maps
			Mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1
			
		Attribute is important for visualisation
		
		
	Parallel Coordinates
		Plot feature values of high-dimensional data
		
		Number of features = number of parallel axis
		
		Different ordering of features can help with visualisation
			Dont want the graph to be too clustered
