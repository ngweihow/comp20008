Similarity Measure/prediction 
	Use raj formula
	
Clustering
	Good clustering method
		Cluster data points so distance between data points are minimised
		Cluser data points so distance between each cluster is maximised
		
	Intra Data Distance
		Distance between data points
	Inter Data Distance
		Distance between data clusters
		
	>Critical point of data clustering is distance measured
	
	
	k-means
		select k seed points as the initial cluster centre for each cluster
		
		assign each data point to each cluster with the nearest seed point
		
		compute new seed points as the centre of the clusters of the curent partioning
		
		repeat step 2-4 again
