Data Linkage and Privacy

	Data matching only within a single organisation and using databases within organisation
		Privacy usually not a concern
		Usually organisation do not have malicious intent
		
		Users know about their information given
		
	Share and make use of multiple databases
		Keep track of a person using multiple records
		
		etc. Hospital, Insurance, Police, Authorities 
		
		>Organisations cant share all their databases
		
		
		Businesses when sharing information together
			Only records that are similar with each another
			
			No sharing of confidential data
		

		Governments
			Security
			
			Tracking suspicious individuals to different databases
				Tax
				Law enforcement
				ADI
				
			
	Without breaking privacy policies
		Methods for computing similarity of recrods
		Not revealing actual record values
		
		Hashing
			Keep name/identity of person as a key
			Information of the individual comes out from hashing but not their identity
			
			
			Non invertible hash function (one way)
				Extremely hard to construct
				
				Impossible to decode using current technology
				
				MD5 Hash Function
				SHA-3-512 Hash Function
				
				>Length of the output does not change
			
			
			Two organisation sharing data
				Use names to match each other's in databases
				Produce a common key
				
				Only use the values and data used only through the key
				
				
				Disadvantages
					Tiny difference in character will produce largely different hash code
					
					Organisation on one side can mount an attack
						Generate all combinations of words 
						Brute force
						
						Fake record in one organisation can, key into the database of another
							Name guessing
							
					
					>Cannot be guruanteed that there would be no privacy/ dictionary attack
					
					Involve a trusted 3rd party
						3rd party only gets the hash code
						No other records received
						Do not know the hash functions
						
						Inform two other parties if there is a match
						
						Cannot guruantee that 3rd party is not malicious
