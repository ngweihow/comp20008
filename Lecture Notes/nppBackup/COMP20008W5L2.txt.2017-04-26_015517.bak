Assessing Correlations
	
	>correlations can be visually identified in scatter plots
		fitting lines through scatter plots
		
	Used to anticipate scenarios if correlations are known
	
	>>>Correlations does not necessarily imply causality
	
	looking at change of variables
	
	
	look at mass correlations through multiple plots and deduce clusters which behaves similarity
	
	if unknown data correlates with known one, function and details can be deduced
		predictions can be made
		
	
	
	
	Euclidean distance
		Compute the euclidean distance between two vectors to work out correlation
