Mutual Information

	Correlation
	Pearson correlation not suitable for quadratics and non linear relations
	
	Requires discrete data
		continuous data need to be discretised 
			Put in ranges/ catergories etc
			
			Equal width bins
				Divide range with number of bins to find bin range (width)
			Equal frequency bins
				Number of values in the list divided by number of bins roughly
				
			
	
	Entropy 
		used to assess the amount of uncertainty in an outcome
			
		Measure the predictability of randomly selected objects
		
		>Capture amount of "surprise" in random selection
		
		>>>Formunla
		Given feature X, H(X) is its entropy
		
			Look at the proportion of items in the bins
			
			apply to each bin
				probability of each bin/type
