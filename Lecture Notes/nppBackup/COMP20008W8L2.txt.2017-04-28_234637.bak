Data Linkage
	
	Combining related/ equivalent records across data sources
	Info related to same entity
	
	Finding links and trends in the datasets
	Finding correlations or unconsistencies in entities
	
	eg. Use of health(hospital history), security(crime), business(address or people)
		academic(research papers), retail(matching existing customers)
		
	eg. Search engines need to link the sites to the correct parallels of the same entity
		Use more details apart from name, years, creator etc
		
		
	Typical Piping
		Standardising data for manipulation
		Different scripts might not comply with ASCII system used for processing 
		
		Easier to match entities which are the same across different databases
