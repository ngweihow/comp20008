Data at Scale

	Big Data
		
		High Demands and High Cost of processing 
		Very high benefits for information
		Privacy Risks
		
		Big infrastructure (Distributed System)
			Cluster Computer(90s)
				Set of computers working together as a single system
			Grid Computing (00s)
				Independent processing of project on lots of device
			Cloud Computing (10s)
				Renting machine/platform to build
				Have people maintain it
				
		Issues
			Consistency & Availability
				Make data always available
					Split data into multiple machines
					Need to synchronise across machines
					
				Consistency
					Data needs to be updated parallel across multiple machines
					Need a smart way of doing this
				
				Conditions
					Each computer needs to view the data similarly 
					All computers can read and write
					System should still work if network problems (partition tolerance)
					
					>>>IMPOSSIBLE to achieve all three 
						CAP theorem
						
					No partition tolerance
						System needs time to sync across machines
						If network is down, sync and availability would be delayed
					
					No consistency
						No synchronisation but system can keep going
						All available
						Change made on multiple machines but might clash
						
					No availability
						Failure in network
						data is kept consistent 
						delay changes until failure is solved
