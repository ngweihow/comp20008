    "- learn how to visualize a set of data using a Python library called `matplotlib`.\n",

    "The power of 'preattentive perception' is the foundation of visualization. People see some things preattentively, without the need of focused attention. These visual properties can be distinguised in less than 200 millisecconds (eye movements take 200 msecs) [Healey, 2005]. What 'preattentive perception' is shall be clarified in the next example.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example uses the maximum temperature data. The CSV-formatted data contains the average maximum temperature recorded for all major Australian cities during the period March 2007 to February 2008 (obtained from the Australian Government's [Bureau of Meteorology](http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/data/)). The data is presented below in two forms: text in a table and a multi-lines plot.\n",

    "    >>> import matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "The device dependent backend is the second part. It is the drawing engine that is responsible to render the visual representation to a file or a display device. Example of backends: 'PS' backend is used to create postscript file (suitable for hardcopy printout), 'SVG' creates scalar vector graphics (SVG file), 'Tkinter' on Windows provides interactive interface to the visualization. E.g. One can use the Agg backend to produce a PNG file, as displayed the example above:\n",
    "\n",
    "     >>> matplotlib.use('Agg')\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pyplot` interface is the last part of the matplotlib package. Module `pyplot` provides a set of functions that utilize the underlying matplotlib library. High level visualization functions like plot, boxplot, and bar, are available through pylab interface. To import these functions, issue the following command:\n",
