Data Linkage
	
	Combining related/ equivalent records across data sources
	Info related to same entity
	
	Finding links and trends in the datasets
	Finding correlations or unconsistencies in entities
	
	eg. Use of health(hospital history), security(crime), business(address or people)
		academic(research papers), retail(matching existing customers)
		
	eg. Search engines need to link the sites to the correct parallels of the same entity
		Use more details apart from name, years, creator etc
		
		
	Typical Piping
		Prep
			Standardising data for manipulation
			Different scripts might not comply with ASCII system used for processing 
			
			Easier to match entities which are the same across different databases
		
		Blocking
			Put pairs into different blocks and elimate need to look at every pairs
			Put records into different blocks according to each attribute/ word in title/name
			
			Look at records in the same block to compare them
			Avoid run time of m*n matches and change into ((m*n)/b)
				where b is the number of blocks

			Blocks made by
				Year number, word in name
				
				Years, upper and lower bound for each block
				lower/higher one years
			
			Best Case = No comparision, just realise after blocking values
			Worst Case = mn, no blocking
			Average Case = mn/b
			
			Larger b, efficiency over accuracy; higher chances to assign into wrong block
			Smaller b, accuracy over efficiency; bigger blocks to go over

		Scoring
			Match pairs together
			
			Jaccard similarity formula
				String processing
				Unique words in both strings
				
				Throw common/noisy words away (A, The, of)
				
			Calculate overall score of similarity for all attributes using function
			Can do weighted sum
			Similarity/dissimilarities
			Machine learning 
			
		Matching
			graph matching techniques
			other matching functions
			
		Linkage
			Matching Records
				Prediction and ground truth
					TN False and Predicted to be False ~m
					FP False and Predicted to be True <m
					FN True and Predicted to be False <m
					TP True and Predicted to be True ~mn-m

			Accuracy = TP+ TN / total
			Link data together
			
	>Data duplication detection
		Work directly on the same dataset
		Higher threshold
