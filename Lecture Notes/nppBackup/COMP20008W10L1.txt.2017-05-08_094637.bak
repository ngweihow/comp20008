	Approximate Similarity
	2-gram string comparision
		break string down to two characters each and compare 
		list of two characters(sub-strings)
			Does not matter the order of the substring
		>use formula
		
		can be q-grams 
			any number appropriate for the data set
			
			lower = more inefficient
			
			higher =  places more emphasis on the order of letters
			
			

	Bloom Filters
		Use hash functions
		Hash string values and place in array
		1 or 0
		
		
		Inserting 2-grams of substring into table
			k would be 2
			hash function returns less than hash table length
			
		>Makes use of very little space
		
		Eg. Used to check URLs which are already set
			Less amount of memory
			Malicious URLs
			
		If already set to 1, do nothing to hash table
			Will get false positives
			Use string comparision to solve this
				Approximate Similarity
					Count the number of bits set to 1
					Count the common bits
					Bits which are set to 1
					Threshold imposed by third party for scale
			
		
		Use a character to state the start and end of string
			Eg. "_"
			
		>Costly
