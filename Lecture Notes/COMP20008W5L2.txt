Assessing Correlations
	
	>correlations can be visually identified in scatter plots
		fitting lines through scatter plots
		
	Used to anticipate scenarios if correlations are known
	
	>>>Correlations does not necessarily imply causality
	
	looking at change of variables
	
	
	look at mass correlations through multiple plots and deduce clusters which behaves similarity
	
	if unknown data correlates with known one, function and details can be deduced
		predictions can be made
		
	
	
	
	Euclidean distance
		Compute the euclidean distance between two vectors to work out correlation 
		similarity between two data groups, far apart the lines/rows are
		if distance is LOW, similarity is HIGH
		
		
		>Does not give a clear intuition about how well variables are correlated
			scales of different measures might not align 
			scales similar would give bias results
			no negative correlation picked up
			
			can be corrected with scaling/normalisation
			
		
		Pearson's correlation coefficient (r)
		>refer for formulae
			perfectly correlated = 1
			perfectly negatively correlated = -1
			no correlation = 0
			
			absolute value of r gives the linear correlation
			
			x bar and y bar are just means
			
			>type of normalisation
			
			0 would produce a well spread cluster 
			
			linear correlation
			
			0.5 - large
			0.3-0.5 - moderated
			0.1-0.3 - small
			0.1> - noise
			
			
			
			cannot detect non-linear relationship
