		Block
			Header
			ID - obtained from hashing the header
			Record of the ID of the parent
			Timestamp of block's creation
			
		Changing a block
			Child nodes would need to change their pointers 
			Headers changed would change address
			Everything following would change
		
		Broadcast information
			Start from one node to its neighbours and spreads out
			Spread recursively
			
		
		>>>Not consistent in practice
			Blocks created simultaneously
			Fake malicious blocks
			
		Public-key Cryptography
		Created
			Public-key
				Access to public
			Private-key
				Public cannot read
				
		Encryption
			Public-key used to encrypt
			Only Holder of Private-key can decrypt the message
