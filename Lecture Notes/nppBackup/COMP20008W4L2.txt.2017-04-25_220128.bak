Hierarchical Clustering

	Transformation of Data
	
	VAT ordering
	find the two furthest points
	randomly pick one of them
	keep looking for points which is colse to selected point
	they are now a set
	find set closest to the sets and merge
	look at the next points nearest to the set
	
		Pseudo Code
		
	>VAT algorithm is not efficient for data with certain structures
	Hierarchical Clustering
		Different way of visualisation
		See the different scale/hierarchy
		Give datapoints without number of clusters
		Give visualisations called dendograms
		
		Two main types
			Agglomerative
				Start with the points as individual clusters
				Each step, merge the closest pair until k clusters 
				until one single cluster
				
			Divisive
				Start with one, all clustered
				split cluster at each step until cluster just has one point (k clusters)
				
			>use similarity or distance matrix (proximity)
			
		
		Proximity Matrix
			The distance between the dots 
			p1 and p1 == 1
			
			finding the clusters to merge
				find the closest two points in each cluster 
				state that is the minimum distance of the two clusters
				
				opposite as maximum distance
				
				similarity can be done either
					find two centroids and take distance between
					
					find average of all distances between points
					
			
		Inter-cluster similarity 
		
			Min single linkage
				closer to 1, closer to other cluster
				
				finding all the minimum distance between all the clusters and
				use that instead (shortest path sorta)
