	Best split
		Calculate the entropy of the children using the formula
		
		Measuring the diversity of the nodes
		
		Split unity
			Information Gain
			Entropy started minus Entropy gained
			
			Weighted Average
			
			>Formula
				Entropy(root) - Entropy(root|split)
				
			Purity of children
			
			>>>Information Gain value of 1 =  best split
				Purest and no ambiguity
