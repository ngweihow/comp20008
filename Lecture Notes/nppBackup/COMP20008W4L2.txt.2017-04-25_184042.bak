Hierarchical Clustering

	Transformation of Data
	
	VAT ordering
	find the two furthest points
	randomly pick one of them
	keep looking for points which is colse to selected point
	they are now a set
	find set closest to the sets and merge
	look at the next points nearest to the set
	
		Pseudo Code
		
	>VAT algorithm is not efficient for data with certain structures
	Hierarchical Clustering
		Different way of visualisation
		See the different scale/hierarchy
		Give datapoints without number of clusters
		Give visualisations called dendograms
		
		Two main types
			Agglomerative
				Start with the points as individual clusters
				Each step, merge the closest pair until k clusters 
			Divisive
				Start with one, all clusted
				split cluster at each step until cluster just has one point (k clusters)
