Data Cleaning
	Data Quality
		Accuracy
		Completeness
		Consistency
		Timelines
		Believability
		Interpretability
		
	
	Terminology
		Each column = feature/ attribute
		Each row = object/ person/ subject matter
		
		
		
	Noisy Data
		Text incorrectly split across cells
		Truncated fields
		Negative values on absolute value scales
		
		Causes
			Imprecise instruments
			Data entry issues
			Data transmisson issues
			
			
	Inconsistent Data
		Different Data Format
		Different data input (Different person)
		
		Outliers
			Usually spot from the context
			Make the detecting technique automated
			
	
	Disguised Data
		Data thats not filled in properly
		Usually just filled in to satisfy the form
		
		
	Missing/ Incomplete Data
		Lacking Feature Values
			eg, ""   null
			
		Some data missing at random
			Flipping a coin/ RNG whether to answer a question or not
		Some not at random
			Prefer not to reveal positive/ negative response
			
			
		Dealing with missing values
			Might bias later results
			Might break application for analysis not expecting it
			
			
			
			Delete all instances of missing values	
				Called deletion
				
				Reduce sample size/ Increase bias in small data sets
				
			Manually correct
				Ask other/peer/specialist to fill in missing data
				They might be bias
				Inefficient
				
			Imputation
				Impute a value for the missing one
				Using standard analysis to replace missing values
				Might not be very accurate
				Would still allow application to work
				
				Fill in values with average or gradient value
					Just ignoring the missing data
					
					
					
	Outlier Analysis
		Outliers are data objects that deviates significantly from normal
		objects as if it were generated by a different mechanism
		
		Good for intrution protection
		
		Outliers can be different from noise data
			Noise is random error or variance in measured variable
			Noise should be REMOVED before outlier detection
			
		Violation of the mechanism that generates the normal data
		
		>Outliers skew average/trend of results
		
		
		GLOBAL outliers
			Object is Og if it significantly deviates from the rest of the 
			data sets
			
			eg. Intrusion detection in computer networks
			Find appropriate measurement of deviation
			
		CONTEXTUAL outliers
