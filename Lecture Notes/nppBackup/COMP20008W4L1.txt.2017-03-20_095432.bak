Similarity Measure/prediction 
	Use raj formula
	
Clustering
	Good clustering method
		Cluster data points so distance between data points are minimised
		Cluser data points so distance between each cluster is maximised
		
	Intra Data Distance
		Distance between data points
	Inter Data Distance
		Distance between data clusters
		
	>Critical point of data clustering is distance measured
	
	
	k-means
		select k seed points as the initial cluster centre for each cluster
		
		assign each data point to each cluster with the nearest seed point
		
		compute new seed points as the centre of the clusters of the curent 
		partioning
			partition according to points and then get mean to produce new 
			centroids
			
		repeat step 2-4 again
		
		
		
		if used on very well clustered data set, worse case might take longer if
		k all end up together
		
		if used on very sparsely clustered data sets, would take longer on average
		case
		
	
	Dissimilarity Matrix
		Computes the distances between different objects in data sets
		
		square differences and sqrt the sum of them together
		
		can be represeneted on heatmaps
		can be represeneted on iris data
