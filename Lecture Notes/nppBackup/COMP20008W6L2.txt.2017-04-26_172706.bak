Classification Methodologies

	classifying a new object inserted into the database using the database
		determine values of property

	Use an algorithm to look at the historical data (Training set)
		Teach the algorithm
		Create a Learn model using induction (function)
		
	Make a prediction for the particular value for the new object
		Apply the model to the test data

	
	
	Regression
		Predicting a continuous value instead of catergory
		
		Predicting an integer instead of catergory
		
		
	Decision Tree
		Split data into variables into different nodes of tree (splitting attributes)
		Paths are each catergory
		
		Applied onto the test data object
		
		Composition
			Internal nodes - test on attributes
			
			Branch - Outcome of test
			
			Leaf nodes - class labels or class distribution
		
		Tree Induction Algorithm
			Used for making trees
			most of them are similar to one another
			
			Hunt's Algorithm
				Let Dt be the set of training records
				
				Pass Dt through nodes each representing to one feature
				Dt splits accordingly
				Recursive calls on each feature until it reaches leaves
