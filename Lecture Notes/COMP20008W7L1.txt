Classifying Methodologies Cont.

	Best split
		Calculate the entropy of the children using the formula
		
		Measuring the diversity of the nodes
		
		Split unity
			Information Gain
			Entropy started minus Entropy gained
			
			Weighted Average
			
			>Formula
				Entropy(root) - Entropy(root|split)
				
			Purity of children
			
			>>>Information Gain value of 1 =  best split
				Purest and no ambiguity
		

			
	Decision Tree
	
		Creating Decision Tree
			Choosing attribute to split by
			Calculate the information gain for each possibility and find the highest one	
			Goes down recursively
		
		Advantage
			Easy to use, walk down tree
			Easy to construct
			Fast for decisions
		Disadvantage
			Greedy construction strategy
				A lot of if rules
				Might let a lot of exceptions go through
				
			Maybe behave strangely
			Look at everything in training data set


		Training and Testing
			Building Tree using the training set
			
		Performance Evaluation
			Four possibilities - construct table
			Actual Class 
			Predicted Class
			
			Accuracy can be calculated
			
			Limitation of accuracy
				If model predicts everything to be near 0 or 100%
				might not be accurate in real scenario
				
	
	
	K- nearest neighbour
		Looking at the test record and see which is the closest ones in training data
		
		>Predicting a single data set from nearest neighbour
		
		Definition of nearest neigbour
			look at most neighbour
			look at the next one recursively until it reaches odd number
			
			deduce the test data from the majority of nearest neighbours
			
			Compute distance
				>Use the euclidean distance formula
				
				>Use pearson coefficient
				
				
				Weighting factor for distance of neighbours votes
					w = 1/d^2

				>>>usually just majority vote

			1 nearest neighbour
				Use Voronoi Diagram
				
				Calculate the class for specific Areas
				
		
		Choosing k 
			too small
				too sensitive
			too large
				neighbourhood might include others
				
			Test possibilities for k
				Choose the most accurate one that predicts values right
				
		Advantages
			Handle complex structures
			
		Disadvantages
			Complexity is highest
			Storing data 
			Choices need to be made to k and distance function
