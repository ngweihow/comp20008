Classification Methodologies

	classifying a new object inserted into the database using the database
		determine values of property

	Use an algorithm to look at the historical data (Training set)
		Teach the algorithm
		Create a Learn model using induction (function)
		
	Make a prediction for the particular value for the new object
		Apply the model to the test data

	
	
	Regression
		Predicting a continuous value instead of catergory
		
		Predicting an integer instead of catergory
		
		
	Decision Tree
		Split data into variables into different nodes of tree (splitting attributes)
		Paths are each catergory
		
		Applied onto the test data object
		
		Composition
			Internal nodes - test on attributes
			
			Branch - Outcome of test
			
			Leaf nodes - class labels or class distribution
		
		Tree Induction Algorithm
			Used for making trees
			most of them are similar to one another
			
			Hunt's Algorithm
				Let Dt be the set of training records
				
				Pass Dt through nodes each representing to one feature
				Dt splits accordingly
				Recursive calls on each feature until it reaches leaves
				
				Stop when node leads to a certain same result for class (all true/ false)
				
			Choosing the node/feature to split on
				Can be random as used by some algorithms
				
				Multi-way split
					partitions by distinct values
					
				Binary split
					divides value into two subsets
					
				Spliting by correlated attributes
					might be more convenient later
					
				Spliting by continuous values
					Binary
						Use thresholds bins
					
					Multi-way
						Use bins
						
				
				Best split
					Greedy approach
						Nodes that are homogeneous by class distribution
						Less mixture of different classes
						
					
					Measuring node impurity
						Use entropy to measure uncertainty in outcome
						
						Low entropy = High Impurity
						High entropy = Low Impurity 
						
						0 entropy = full certainty of class obtained
