Public Data Release

	Release data for public benefits and research purposes
	Give company advantage
	
	
	>Public thinks computer scientists have easy access into private information
	
	Combination of data for identifying
		eg. zip code, birthday and sex
		
		linking data to breach privacy 
			use two similar platforms
	
	>put noise into dataset to further protect privacy of users
	
	
	Perserving the anonymity of data before public release
		k-anonymity
		l-diversity
		
		Explicity identifier
			Unique identifyer
			Names etc
			Use hash functions to encrypt
			
		Quasi
			Non-sensitive data that can be used to identify entity
			usually used in combination
			
		Sensitive attribute
			information meant to be kept private
			
			
	k-anonymity
		make sure every set of data released protective of privacy but useful
		
		determine quasi
		
		make any user indisguisable from k-1 number of other users in dataset
			pick a fair value of k-1
			
			Choosing k
				Larger k
					More privacy
					More distortion to data
					Loosing information
					
				
			>Making quasi less specific
				use quasi catergory for root of tree
				
				hiding values/digits of code
					hide from right
				
				>>>try to loose as little detail for data as possible
				
			Suppression
				Limit amount of outliers
					retain current usability of data
				
				outlier would cause each quasi category to move up
					generalise to protect privacy
				
	Background attack
		use background information to locate user
		know the details of the sensitive information
