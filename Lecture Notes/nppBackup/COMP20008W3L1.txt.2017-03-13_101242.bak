Outliers in Data	
	Use gaussian plots
	Data usually come from normal distribution
	
	1d or 2d plots are better
	3d plots might be unclear
	
	
	1d data
		Boxplots
		Histograms
		Statistical Tests
		
	2d data
		Scatter plot and eyeball
		
		
		
		
		
		
Missing Data
	
	Fill in missing data using recommendation
	
	Recommender System
		Based on past data
		Each user has a profile
			Explicit Info - Give score
			Implicit Info - Time spent on viewing item
			
			
		Collaborative Filter
			Look at users' collective behaviour
			Predict missing values of user using past information
			Finding the rating between given user and item
			
			User based methods
				Identify similar users
				Compute similarity between users and other users
				Data based off the ratings of neighbours(most similar)
				
				Measure similarity average method
					Compute average values based on other score
					Only accurate if sample size is large
					
				Measure similarity squared Euclidean
					Ignore all missing values
					Calculate squared Euclidean distance between vectors from 
					pairs
					
				Correalation similarity
				Cosine similarity between vector angles
				
				Method is slow as there are many users
					Need to select users to compare
					Need to pick the most similar users
					
			Item based methods
				Identify similar items
			Model (matrix) Models
				Solve an optimisation problem and identify latent factors
